GraphPlotting.py
This code is repsonsible for all the raw data analysis and figure plotting for the final report. Below is a brief list of outputs
- Final Weighted average for g with uncertainty (from Pendulumn)
- Final value of g from curve_fit (from Ball drop)
- Plots of the experimental data
- Plots of the modelled curved ontop of the experimental data

NonLinear Drag model.py
This is an example of how the trajectories for the pendulumn are plot numerically using the euler method, it produces,
- A trajectory plot in space
- A phase plot, modelling the change in velocity
